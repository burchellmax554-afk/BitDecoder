This repository contains a MATLAB-based digital communication system developed as part of an undergraduate electrical and computer engineering coursework project. The system implements
a frequency-shift keying (FSK) transmitter and receiver capable of encoding, transmitting, and decoding binary data using distinct carrier frequencies. The project emphasizes core 
signal processing concepts such as modulation, spectral analysis, filtering, and bit recovery.

The original implementation was designed to operate with live audio input and output, demonstrating a complete end-to-end communication pipeline using physical hardware. To improve 
portability, the project was later extended with an offline validation version that removes hardware and toolbox dependencies while preserving the original transmitter and receiver 
logic.
